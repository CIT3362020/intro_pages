    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
       I am currently a senior communications major here at Pace University. I have little coding experience
       but it is something that I have always been interested in, and since I only have electives left, I thought
       this class would help my skills, especially since I juts accepted a position working in the community department of
       hercampus.com for after graduation.
    </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
    
        I have little to no experience in coding, other than CIS101, so this class is a challenge for me 
        but I am ready and willing to learn. If anyone lives in Beekman and would like to do work together on   
        figuring out assingments, sort of a study group that would be amazing.   
     
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
        To learn a basic understanding through this course to be able to translate to future work opportunities.
