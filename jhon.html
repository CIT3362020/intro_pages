<h1 align="center"><i>About me</h1>

<p align="center"><i> Hey yall,<br/>I'm a first generation college student and it is my last semester at Pace. I am so excited to graduate.
    I like coding, but im not great at it. So I am looking forward to getting more practice in and hopefully I can get comfotable and good at coding.
     I have a lot of hobbies. I like to play soccer, read, and workout. But the one thing that I enjoy the most is to go in pincics. Last sunday it was like 58 
     and I took advantage of that and went on a picnic with my friends.</i></p>
<p align="center">Why do I like picnics so much? I'm not sure, I just like the environment and being out in the open and enjoying nature.
    I like being outside and looking around to see what nature gives us.</p>
