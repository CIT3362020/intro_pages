        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
           Hi! I currently live in New York, but I was born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam. I moved here in 2017 for college.
           My major is IT (focus in Web & Digital Media) and I'm minoring in Photography. I'm a senior graduating this May!
           Fun fact: I have a scuba diving license and swam with turtles in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>I'm expected to graduate May 2020 with BS in Information Technology from Pace University.</li>
            <li>I'm studying IT but my passion lies in photography. I'm currently freelancing right now for a fashion brand photographing products and developing their e-commerce site.</li>
            <li>I'm currently the President of UNICEF USA here at Pace.</li>
            <li>I'm working at the Learning Center as a Computer Science tutor.</li>
            <li>I've interned as a content creator in the past for an IT company.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            In the far far future I hope to be able to work on photography full time.
            But for now my parents want me to be able to survive on my own so I hope to do web dev things for a non-profit.
