        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
           I currently live in a lake house in Coventry, CT with my little dog, Douglas, who is the love of my life. 
           This summer I started working as a software engineer for Plex, a totally remote company that makes media server software. I currently work on the smart speakers team, so I write middleware that allows you to stream music from your server to all of your smart speakers. I get to listen to music all day.
           I'm a long distance runner and belong to a makerspace where I do some woodworking and play with lasers.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>I graduated with my BS in Computer Science from Pace University in 2015.</li>
            <li>During my time as an undergrad, I was the project manager at Seidenberg Creative Labs, a web and mobile development agency run by students (If you don't know about it, but you're interested, ask me!)</li>
            <li>I also participated in the Product Development Project in Helsinki, Finland, working with engineering and design students to develop products for Finnish companies.</li>
            <li>I became involved with FIRST robotics, volunteering at many FTC tournaments where high schoolers build amazing robots that play games. I also coached a Lego robotics team on the Upper East Side. I used to teach the Lego robotics class at Pace until I moved too far away from NYC.</li>
            <li>I started an education technology startup, teaching people how to code.</li>
            <li>After graduating, I started working as a web developer at a digital agency near Wall Street. After a year, I came back to Pace and started teaching this class!</li>
            <li>While teaching, I completed my MS in Computer Science here at Pace - I made a smart mirror for my thesis project. I finished my MS in Spring 2018.</li>
            <li>Now I'm a software engineer for Plex!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            Teach more people how to make web applications!
            Someday I would like to get my PhD and teach full-time, but I've got to admit - programming from a lake house is kind of the dream.
