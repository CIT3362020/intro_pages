            <h2> About Me </h2>   
                <p> My name is Christine. I am a senior Accounting major, graduating in May. I am from Connecticut and used to live on the Pleasantville Campus until this past semester.
                    I moved to Atlanta in February to work, save money, study for my CPA, and finish taking classes. I have taken a few CS and CIT classes the last couple years at Pace, 
                    it interests me. While at Pace, I worked at the Dean for Students office and was on the Cheerleading team. After moving to Atlanta, I got a puppy! His name is King, 
                    he is 4 months old and is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. My parents are immigrants from India, so I speak multiple languages including English, Malayalam, Spanish, 
                    and some Hindi.
                </p>  
            <h2> Hobbies </h2>
                <p> I workout every day and love to dance. I have been on dance teams since i was young until 2 years ago. I also am a big travelor.
                    The last two pictures are from my last two trips at the beginning of this year to Costa Rica and Belize. I am a big fan of football and basketball,
                    recently started watching soccer since many people in Atlanta are big soccer fans. I love nature and going on hikes and being by any type of body of water.
