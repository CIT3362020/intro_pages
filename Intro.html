            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
              I am a senior majoring in Information Technology. Prior to transferring to Pace in the fall 2018 semester, I was a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology
			  where I received my associates degree. I changed my school and major because I wanted to learn more about technology. The almost two years I've spent at Pace 
			  have been challenging yet interesting. I have no idea as to what I would like to do after I graduate, however, I am looking forward to the future.
