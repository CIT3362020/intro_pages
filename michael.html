            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work as a Cloud Technical Expert for Microsoft. I have been with them for a little over two and a half years, and I have been in my current role for about a year and a half. However, this first project is my first time writing and code. I recently did a training for Pace's IT staff on Microsoft Teams. During my time at Pace, I am pursuing a degree in Information Systems. 
                <br><br> More importantly, you can see some pictures of my dog, Dakota, to the right. She's a Siberian Husky that's been with me for about 13 years now. Her favorite place to sleep, as seen to the right, is on the top of my couch cushions. Her two favorite activities consist of running back and forth until she tires herself out and sleeping.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My current goals are to finish my degree and continue moving up inside of Microsoft. On a more personal note, I want to ensure that I maintain and build upon a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy going to the gym, but I also really love ice cream.
