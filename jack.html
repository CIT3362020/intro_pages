            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I am a 5th year senior at Pace Univeristy, I'm going for a 150 credits BBA. In order to sit or take the
                CPA (Ceritified Public Accounting) you would need 150 credits hence the 5th year.
                I needed an elective and I have interest in coding thanks to my roommate, Jacob. Although he made it
                more interesting, I had some past experience back in Highschool but that was all
                HTML and CSS none of the Java I hope to learn.
            </p>
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I have little to no experience in coding other then some Highschool class and CIS 101. The class will a fun one
                since I wanted to do coding as a miner but I needed to make some career changes in order to gradute on time. I have a 
                programmer friend who is willing to teach me some code. 
            </p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                To eventually code a program that bigger companies would want to buy out from me.
