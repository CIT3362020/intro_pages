<p>
Hi! 
My name is Fran. 

I am a senior at Pace's NYC campus. 
<br>I am art major but my main focus is graphic design. I grew up in the Bronx but I am from Washington Heights. I was hoping to learn more about coding since graphic and web design goes hand in hand now-a-days.


On my free time I mostly work. I work for the city as a design intern. <br>
If I am not working, Im either hanging out with my friends or moving through the city taking photos digitally or on film.
